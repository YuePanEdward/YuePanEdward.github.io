## About Me

I am a currently a senior undergraduate student in School of Computer Science and Engineering(CSE), [University of Electronic Science and Technology of China(UESTC)](http://www.uestc.edu.cn/). I have been working in [Prof. Qu](http://yz.uestc.edu.cn/daoshijieshao/mentor.php?id=11006)'s group since 2016. My research interest lies in Neural Language Processing(NLP), including text generation, music generation, text summarization, question answering, etc.

I am about to go to [University of Lethbridge](https://www.uleth.ca/) for Mitacs Intern in Summer 2018. I'll be focusing on the field of NLP, supervised by [Professor Yllias Chali](http://www.cs.uleth.ca/~chali/).

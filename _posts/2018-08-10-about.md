## About Me
I am [Yue Pan 潘越(Edward)](https://www.yuepanedward.com/) from China.
I am currently an undergraduate student majoring in Geodesy and Geomatics (also known as Surveying and Mapping) at [Wuhan University(WHU)](http://en.whu.edu.cn/).

At present, I am acting as a research assistant funded by CSC and Mitacs at [University of Alberta - Edmonton](https://www.ualberta.ca/) on the topic of SLAM.

My research interest is on Point Cloud Technology (3D Compter Vision), SLAM (Robotics) and sensor integration.

### About Me
I am [Yue Pan 潘越(Edward)](https://www.yuepanedward.com/) from China.
I am currently a master student majoring in Geomatics Engineering at [ETH Zurich](https://ethz.ch/en.html). 

I graduated from [Wuhan University](https://en.whu.edu.cn/) in June 2019 and got my Bachelor Degree. I exchanged at [HK PolyU](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/web/en/home/index.html) in 2017. I acted as a research assistant at Wuhan University [LIESMARS](http://www.lmars.whu.edu.cn/en/) from 2017 to 2019 and at [University of Alberta](https://www.ualberta.ca/) in 2018. Besides, I interned at [CHC Navigation](https://www.chcnav.com/index) in 2018, [Sensetime](https://www.sensetime.com/en/) in 2019 and [Hesai](https://www.hesaitech.com/en/) in 2020.

[Details in [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/yue-pan-59461b148/)]

My research interest is on 3D Computer Vision, SLAM and sensor integration.
